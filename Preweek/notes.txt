Notes
Week 1: Architecting GenAI

Predictive ML vs GenAI
When to choose which?
-gen ai 
    models are bigger
    create open ended solutions
    saas foundational model
    millions/billions parameters for training
    gen ai allows for a quicker start
    (hard to control)
-ml
    removes the need to train your own models
    predictive ml is more aligned to creating custom models and specific use cases
    thousands/millions parameters for training
    makes sense for large workloads and long term investment

All levels of technical diagramming
3 levels

TOGAF (open group architecture)
    
    3 types of diagrams: address the different layers of stakeholders that you will be talking to when creating a project
        -conceptual: (c-suite)
            (napkin scratching) how things are put together
            at a high level how things feed to other things (prev. diagrams)
        -logical: ()
            architecting a blueprint
            logical design
            names, measurements and weights
        -physical
            bill of materials
            names of services
            ip addresses and locations of ec2 instances, arms of services
