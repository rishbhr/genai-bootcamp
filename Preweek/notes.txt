Notes
Week 1: Architecting GenAI

Predictive ML vs GenAI
When to choose which?
-gen ai 
    models are bigger
    create open ended solutions
    saas foundational model
    millions/billions parameters for training
    gen ai allows for a quicker start
    (hard to control)
-ml
    removes the need to train your own models
    predictive ml is more aligned to creating custom models and specific use cases
    thousands/millions parameters for training
    makes sense for large workloads and long term investment

All levels of technical diagramming
C4 Model
TOGAF (by open group architecture)
    3 types of diagrams: address the different layers of stakeholders that you will be talking to when creating a project
        -conceptual: (c-suite)
            (napkin scratching) how things are put together
            at a high level how things feed to other things (prev. diagrams)
        -logical: (architects)
            architecting a blueprint
            logical design
            names, measurements and weights
        -physical: (engineering)
            bill of materials
            names of services
            ip addresses and locations of ec2 instances, arms of services


Homework for preweek
-genai-architecting
-sentence-constructor

Hypothesis and technical uncertainty
-evaluate the various ai models and which fits the usecase the best

Technical Exploration
-a prompt document incrementally with specific various models

Final Outcomes
-

-------------------
Homework

-Create a chat agent that guides to an answer but does not provide the answer
-Technical uncertainty
 -r&d process documentation
 -what are the boundaries of what the ai agents can do
 -build a teaching assistant
  -the larger the task for an llm, the harder it can be for them to perform
 -can the agent that we build be replicated
 -how does the agent integrate into existing stack
 -how does prompt documents from one ai to another
 -prompt engineering
  -document the instructions to for the ai agent
 -features that are available for different ai agents
 -
